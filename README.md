## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an overly enthusiastic Software Engineer predominantly working with anything JavaScript/TypeScript! 

Long-time experience developing web applications using both React & Angular (HTML, JS, SCSS), back-end applications and microservices using tools like NodeJS, NestJS, TypeORM, LoopBack and Socket.IO. Utilising DB solutions like MongoDB, Redis, MySQL, SQLite and more...

Strong affinity for things DevOps- Happily spinning up clusters and containerising my projects to have them autoscaled in Kubernetes- How about you?

Love automating my workflows using CI/CD to build, test and publish my work to deliver you the best experience!
